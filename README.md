MVC framework for Node.js and Bun with built-in HTTP/2, multi-bundle architecture, and scope-based data isolation — no Express dependency.

- **HTTP/2 first.** Built-in `isaac` server with TLS, h2c, ALPN, HTTP/1.1 fallback, and full CVE hardening (Rapid Reset, CONTINUATION flood, RST flood, HPACK bomb) — all on by default.
- **Multi-bundle.** One project hosts multiple independent bundles (API, web, admin, …). Each bundle has its own routing, controllers, models, and config. Share code via the project layer.
- **Scope isolation.** Run `local`, `beta`, and `production` from the same codebase. Scopes propagate through routing, config interpolation, and data (every DB record is stamped with `_scope`).
- **Batteries included.** Forms & validation, sessions, uploads, async jobs, response caching, CSRF, security headers, route authorization, audit trail, i18n, OpenAPI + MCP generation — built in, not bolted on.

## Features

| Feature | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP/2 server | Built-in `isaac` engine — TLS, h2c, ALPN, HTTP/1.1 fallback, 103 Early Hints, CVE-hardened |
| Multi-bundle | One project, N independent bundles with shared config and project layer |
| Scope isolation | `local` / `beta` / `production` — per-request and per-record |
| MVC routing | `routing.json` — declare routes in config, not code; O(m) radix trie lookup |
| Async/await | Controller actions can be `async`; rejections routed to `throwError` automatically |
| WebSockets | WS routes in `routing.json` (`"method": "ws"` + channel handlers, `:param` paths); WebSocket-over-HTTP/2 (RFC 8441) |
| ORM / entities | EventEmitter-based entity system; SQL files auto-wired to entity methods |
| Connectors | Couchbase, MongoDB, ScyllaDB / Cassandra, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, SQLite, AI (LLM) — loaded from project `node_modules` |
| AI connector | Any LLM provider via named protocol (`anthropic://`, `openai://`, `ollama://`, …) — unified `.infer()`, token streaming via `.stream()`, inference-as-a-job via `self.inferAsync()` |
| Template engine | [`@rhinostone/swig`](https://github.com/gina-io/swig) — maintained fork with CVE-2023-25345 patched; streaming SSE/chunked via `renderStream()`. Nunjucks supported as opt-in via `render.engine = "nunjucks"` or per-section `"ext": ".njk"` |
| Forms & validation | One rule engine for client and server — live checks, cross-field rules, ARIA states, localised messages; the server enforces the same rules on submit |
| DTOs | `gina.dto` schema builder — request validation with localised 422s (`param.dto`), response shaping (`param.responseDto`), JSON Schema export |
| Sessions | Hardened session plugin (SameSite / HttpOnly / Secure defaults) — Redis, SQLite, MongoDB, Couchbase, and ScyllaDB stores; session-id rotation on login, opt-in absolute timeout, record destroyed on logout |
| File uploads | Multipart via the maintained [`@rhinostone/busboy`](https://github.com/gina-io/busboy) fork — named upload groups with per-group extension allow-lists, size / count limits, and target dirs |
| Object storage | `gina.storage()` — named drivers pairing an adapter (`local` filesystem, or `s3` for any S3-compatible provider with its SDK as a project-side dependency) with a key strategy behind opaque keys: `sharded` (dated), `cas` (content-addressed, deduplicating, refcounted, GC-swept) and `stream` (large media, resumable out-of-order segment uploads); size tiering, HTTP Range serving (`serveFromStorage()` — 206/416/304, strong key ETags), presigned-URL offload (307) on `s3`, embedded SQLite or Couchbase metadata store, `storage:stats` / `gc` / `verify` CLI |
| Async jobs | `self.startJob()` background jobs — durable SQLite / MongoDB / Redis stores, retries with backoff, HMAC-signed completion webhooks, `/_gina/jobs/:id` status endpoint |
| Response caching | Per-route render cache — memory / fs / Redis tiers, cross-replica warm start, event-driven invalidation, RFC 9211 `Cache-Status` |
| Authentication | `lib.authn` primitives — scrypt password hashing as self-describing PHC strings (argon2 / bcrypt verify-only for migration), NIST SP 800-63B policy, enumeration-safe `dummyVerify`, PCI-DSS account lockout, RFC 6238 TOTP |
| Route authorization | `requireAuth` / `roles` / `policy` per route or deny-by-default, login bounce with `resumeRequest()`, `self.hasRole()` |
| Rate limiting | Opt-in identified-caller quotas at the router (#MS6) — fixed-window counters over the KV primitive (per-process, or replica-shared via redis/sqlite), per-route overrides/exemptions, 429 + `Retry-After` + draft `RateLimit` header fields; anonymous flood control stays at your edge by design |
| Audit trail | Opt-in append-only JSONL audit log (`self.audit()`), authorization denials auto-recorded, always-on request ids; opt-in HMAC hash chain verified offline by `gina audit:verify` |
| CSRF protection | Signed double-submit token middleware + Origin/Referer pre-filter + hardened session cookie |
| Security headers | CSP with per-response nonces, HSTS, COOP / COEP / CORP, Referrer-Policy and the X-* family — per-header plugins or one `SecurityHeaders` wrapper |
| Secrets | `${secret:KEY}` placeholders in bundle config — fail-closed, env-backed, with opt-in file and exec-bridge tiers beneath the environment; `secrets:scan` / `secrets:check` CLI |
| Internationalisation | Per-bundle JSON catalogs, `t()` helper, swig + nunjucks `t` filter, CLDR plurals, ICU MessageFormat opt-in via `t.icu()` |
| Exact money | `lib.money` / `gina.money` — ISO 4217 minor-unit integer arithmetic (BigInt-safe), strict wire-string parsing, same-currency guards; display via `Intl.NumberFormat` |
| Idempotency keys | Opt-in `Idempotency-Key` dedup at the router band (IETF draft): retried mutations replay the recorded first response — 409 while in flight, 422 on payload reuse, principal-scoped over the kv primitive |
| Message validation | `param.messageValidator` — a route-level seam running the raw request body through an application-supplied validator (XSD sidecar, JSON Schema, anything) before the action: boot-compiled factory, sync or async, fail-closed 400/422/503 refusals with `Retry-After` on checker outage |
| XML in and out | `application/xml`, `text/xml` and `application/*+xml` request bodies reach the action verbatim on `req.body`; `self.renderXML()` sends pre-serialised responses with the right content type and charset. The application brings its own XML library — the framework parses none and builds none |
| Observability | Built-in `/_gina/metrics` Prometheus endpoint (opt-in, IP-allowlisted) — process metrics + HTTP counter / duration histogram with cardinality-safe route labels; structured JSON logs with request ids (`GINA_LOG_FORMAT=json`) |
| Dev Inspector | Embedded dev SPA at `/_gina/inspector` — request data, live logs, SQL with index-coverage badges, flow timings, app events, AI token stream |
| OpenAPI & MCP | `bundle:openapi` emits OpenAPI 3.1 from `routing.json`; `bundle:mcp` emits an MCP tool manifest; built-in MCP runtime server (stdio + Streamable HTTP) |
| TypeScript & ESM | Typed public surface (shipped `.d.ts`), `bundle:types` generates entity types from DTOs, dual CJS / ESM exports |
| Hot reload | WatcherService evicts `require.cache` only on file change — zero per-request overhead in dev |
| K8s ready | `gina-container`, `gina-init`, SIGTERM drain, JSON stdout logging |
| Container tooling | `image:build` synthesizes an OCI image (buildah), `image:run` / `container:ps` / `container:stop` (podman) — local or over SSH |
| Dependency injection | Mockable connectors and config for unit testing |
| Runtime | Node.js 22–26, or **Bun** (`bun add -g gina`) — install + boot validated end-to-end by a CI Bun smoke |

## Quick start

```bash
npm install -g gina@latest --prefix=~/.npm-global   # or, on the Bun runtime: bun add -g gina
gina project:add @myproject --path=$(pwd)/myproject
gina bundle:add api @myproject
gina bundle:start api @myproject
open https://localhost:3100
```

> **npm 12+** blocks install scripts by default, and gina's post-install bootstraps `~/.gina` and the framework dependencies. Install with `npm install -g gina@latest --allow-scripts=gina`, or allow it once for all global installs with `npm config set allow-scripts=gina --location=user`. (Not needed on npm ≤ 11.)

## What's in 0.6.29

> **Restart your bundles *and* rebuild them.** Two of the fixes are
> browser-bundled — the field-error painter and the staged-upload preview slot —
> so `gina.min.js` changed and `gina bundle:restart` alone leaves the old client
> running. Rebuild each consuming bundle, then restart.

> **No settings reset.** `0.6.29` is a patch — the `shortVersion` stays `0.6`,
> so your `~/.gina/0.6/settings.json` is untouched. (`0.6.0` was the reset.)

**The right-destination release.** Four of the five changes are a value arriving
somewhere it should not, or failing to arrive where it should: a failed query
carrying its own result rows into every log that printed the error, a field
error stopping on a control that could never display it, a staged upload posting
the literal `[object Object]`, and a retina asset path cut in half at its `@`.
The fifth is the opposite kind of change — `bundle:build` learns to do nothing
at all when there is nothing to do. Full detail in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

- **Security — a failed N1QL statement no longer carries its own result rows (#B509).** The couchbase connector placed the query service's whole response envelope — result documents included — on `error.stack` and `error.cause.http_body`, so a `RETURNING` statement that lost a CAS race, or a SELECT that timed out part-way, wrote the records it had already produced into any log that printed the error. The controller error path prints the stack in every scope, and a bare `console.error(err)` renders the cause, so there was no interception point for a bundle. Both now carry the envelope with `results` replaced by a row-count marker; `errors`, `requestID`, `status`, `signature` and the classifier's `first_error_code`/`retry` are unchanged, the SDK's own error object is copied rather than mutated, and a body the connector cannot parse is dropped rather than forwarded.
- **Added — `bundle:build` and `project:build` gain `--skip-unchanged`.** A release whose bundle source is byte-identical to what it was built from keeps its copy. The build signs the source — the sha1 of every file's bytes and every symlink's target, so timestamps do not count and a fresh checkout or a plain `cp` does not invalidate — records that signature at the release root as `.gina-build.json`, and skips the wipe-and-copy when it matches. Everything else still runs: the manifest update, the fingerprint stamp, the `node_modules` link and both hooks. Any doubt rebuilds, and nothing changes without the flag. `--force` rebuilds anyway and still records the marker, `--dry-run` prints each release's decision and its reason without touching anything, and the `postbuild` hook receives `GINA_BUILD_SKIPPED_BUNDLES` / `GINA_BUILD_SKIPPED_ALL` so a hook that bakes its own outputs can skip its own work.
- **Fixed — a server-side field error reaches the visible control (#B510).** The client-side painter walked the form in document order and stopped on the first control whose name matched, whether or not it could paint it — and a bare `type="hidden"` control never can. So with the recommended shape for a control that must render disabled yet still post (a visible control plus a hidden twin carrying rule `"exclude": false`), a hidden twin listed first consumed the error: no message, no `aria-invalid`, and on a shared wrapper the error class was set with nothing inside it. A bare hidden control is now skipped when another control of the same name can be painted; a lone hidden one keeps the former behaviour, and one inside a `form-item-wrapper` is still painted after its wrapper.
- **Fixed — a path-form `getUrl` route containing `@` no longer renders a 500 (#B511).** Both the swig and the nunjucks filter split every `@`-bearing route as `rule@bundle` before checking whether it was a path, so the retina-asset idiom the filter's own comment cites — `'/assets/img/common/header@2x.png' | getUrl` — was cut at the `@`, failed the bundle lookup on the remainder and called `throwError(500)` mid-template, returning a 500 while the action's own render was discarded. A route with a leading `/` now bypasses the split on both engines. One consequence to know: a path-form route cannot name a bundle in-string (`'/x.png@web'`) — pass it as the filter's base argument (`| getUrl(null, 'web')`), which was already the working form and is unchanged.
- **Fixed — a staged upload no longer posts `[object Object]` (#B459).** The client writes one hidden input per metadata field into the real form, auto-creating any the form did not declare — and `preview`, whose value is an object rather than a string, was auto-created like the others, so a form declaring no `[preview][...]` sub-fields got a flat input that the fill loop string-coerced. Such a form now posts no `preview` field at all, matching the documented field set; the thumbnail still renders, and a form that declares the `[preview][location|uri|width|height]` sub-fields is unchanged — declaring them remains the way to persist the preview. Server code that keyed on the *presence* of a `preview` field for such forms should key on its value: it was garbage before and is absent now.

## Governance

Gina is co-authored by **Martin Luther ETOUMAN NDAMBWE** ([Rhinostone](https://rhinostone.com)) and **Fabrice DELANEAU** ([fdelaneau.com](https://fdelaneau.com)). Final decisions on direction, API design, and releases rest with Martin Luther. Community contributions and RFCs are welcome and taken seriously. See [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md) for details.

## Supply-chain scanners

Gina is an MVC framework with a process-management CLI, so it uses Node's
`child_process` by design — to start and supervise application bundle processes
and the framework daemon, run local/SSH commands (`lib/shell`), launch the
inspector, and perform setup in the npm install scripts. Supply-chain scanners
therefore report a **Shell access** capability for `child_process`. This is
expected and intrinsic to a CLI framework, not a vulnerability: the install-time
commands are built only from local values (npm prefix, install path) and take no
network input.
