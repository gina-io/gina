MVC framework for Node.js and Bun with built-in HTTP/2, multi-bundle architecture, and scope-based data isolation — no Express dependency.

- **HTTP/2 first.** Built-in `isaac` server with TLS, h2c, ALPN, HTTP/1.1 fallback, and full CVE hardening (Rapid Reset, CONTINUATION flood, RST flood, HPACK bomb) — all on by default.
- **Multi-bundle.** One project hosts multiple independent bundles (API, web, admin, …). Each bundle has its own routing, controllers, models, and config. Share code via the project layer.
- **Scope isolation.** Run `local`, `beta`, and `production` from the same codebase. Scopes propagate through routing, config interpolation, and data (every DB record is stamped with `_scope`).
- **Batteries included.** Forms & validation, sessions, uploads, async jobs, response caching, CSRF, security headers, route authorization, audit trail, i18n, OpenAPI + MCP generation — built in, not bolted on.

## Features

| Feature | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP/2 server | Built-in `isaac` engine — TLS, h2c, ALPN, HTTP/1.1 fallback, 103 Early Hints, RFC 9218 request priorities, CVE-hardened |
| Multi-bundle | One project, N independent bundles with shared config and project layer |
| Scope isolation | `local` / `beta` / `production` — per-request and per-record |
| MVC routing | `routing.json` — declare routes in config, not code; an index built once per routing table narrows each cold match to the rules the URL could reach, and a hot path is served from the route cache |
| Fast lane | Opt-in JSON routes without a controller — `param.lane` names a handler module under `lanes/` that answers with `ctx.json()` / `ctx.error()`; the request id, CORS, the bundle's session and CSRF middleware, the metrics and the error envelope stay as on any route |
| Async/await | Controller actions can be `async`; rejections routed to `throwError` automatically |
| WebSockets | WS routes in `routing.json` (`"method": "ws"` + channel handlers, `:param` paths); WebSocket-over-HTTP/2 (RFC 8441) |
| ORM / entities | EventEmitter-based entity system; SQL files auto-wired to entity methods |
| Connectors | Couchbase, MongoDB, ScyllaDB / Cassandra, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, SQLite, AI (LLM) — loaded from project `node_modules` |
| AI connector | Any LLM provider via named protocol (`anthropic://`, `openai://`, `ollama://`, …) — unified `.infer()`, token streaming via `.stream()`, inference-as-a-job via `self.inferAsync()` |
| Template engine | [`@rhinostone/swig`](https://github.com/gina-io/swig) — maintained fork with CVE-2023-25345 patched; streaming SSE/chunked via `renderStream()`. Nunjucks supported as opt-in via `render.engine = "nunjucks"` or per-section `"ext": ".njk"` |
| Forms & validation | One rule engine for client and server — live checks, cross-field rules, ARIA states, localised messages; the server enforces the same rules on submit. A form can swap its HTML answer into any element of the page, htmx-style (`data-gina-form-target` / `-swap` / `-select`), and update elements elsewhere out of band (`data-gina-swap-oob`); the server can retarget, reswap or reselect that answer with `X-Gina-Retarget` / `-Reswap` / `-Reselect` response headers. Two answers replacing the same region coordinate on their own — derived from the swap strategy, with no attribute to write — and `data-gina-form-sync` overrides that where it is wrong, while `data-gina-form-disabled-elt` holds controls disabled for the life of a request |
| DTOs | `gina.dto` schema builder — request validation with localised 422s (`param.dto`), response shaping (`param.responseDto`), JSON Schema export |
| Sessions | Hardened session plugin (SameSite / HttpOnly / Secure defaults) — Redis, SQLite, MongoDB, Couchbase, and ScyllaDB stores; session-id rotation on login, per-bundle login and remember-me cookie lifetimes from `security.json`, opt-in absolute timeout, record destroyed on logout |
| File uploads | Multipart via the maintained [`@rhinostone/busboy`](https://github.com/gina-io/busboy) fork — named upload groups with per-group extension allow-lists, size / count limits, and target dirs |
| Object storage | `gina.storage()` — named drivers pairing an adapter (`local` filesystem, or `s3` for any S3-compatible provider with its SDK as a project-side dependency) with a key strategy behind opaque keys: `sharded` (dated), `cas` (content-addressed, deduplicating, refcounted, GC-swept) and `stream` (large media, resumable out-of-order segment uploads); size tiering, HTTP Range serving (`serveFromStorage()` — 206/416/304, strong key ETags), presigned-URL offload (307) on `s3`, embedded SQLite or Couchbase metadata store, `storage:stats` / `gc` / `verify` CLI |
| Async jobs | `self.startJob()` background jobs — durable SQLite / MongoDB / Redis stores, retries with backoff, HMAC-signed completion webhooks, `/_gina/jobs/:id` status endpoint |
| Response caching | Per-route render cache — memory / fs / Redis tiers, cross-replica warm start, event-driven invalidation, RFC 9211 `Cache-Status` |
| Authentication | `lib.authn` primitives — scrypt password hashing as self-describing PHC strings (argon2 / bcrypt verify-only for migration), NIST SP 800-63B policy, enumeration-safe `dummyVerify`, PCI-DSS account lockout, RFC 6238 TOTP |
| Route authorization | `requireAuth` / `roles` / `policy` per route or deny-by-default, login bounce with `resumeRequest()`, `self.hasRole()` |
| Rate limiting | Opt-in identified-caller quotas at the router (#MS6) — fixed-window counters over the KV primitive (per-process, or replica-shared via redis/sqlite), per-route overrides/exemptions, 429 + `Retry-After` + draft `RateLimit` header fields; anonymous flood control stays at your edge by design |
| Maintenance mode | Opt-in `server.maintenance` (#MAINT1) — every request answered 503 + `Retry-After` before statics, cache and routing while `/_gina/*` stays reachable; topology-neutral bypass (`x-gina-maintenance-key` header, or a one-shot query grant minted into a signed cookie) plus a non-proxied IP allowlist; runtime toggle `POST /_gina/maintenance` with a dead-man `ttlSeconds`, `GINA_MAINTENANCE` to boot closed, and replica coherence through a shared KV namespace (`store`) |
| Audit trail | Opt-in append-only JSONL audit log (`self.audit()`), authorization denials auto-recorded, always-on request ids; opt-in HMAC hash chain verified offline by `gina audit:verify` |
| CSRF protection | Signed double-submit token middleware + Origin/Referer pre-filter + hardened session cookie |
| Security headers | CSP with per-response nonces, HSTS, COOP / COEP / CORP, Referrer-Policy and the X-* family — per-header plugins or one `SecurityHeaders` wrapper |
| Secrets | `${secret:KEY}` placeholders in bundle config — fail-closed, env-backed, with opt-in file and exec-bridge tiers beneath the environment; `secrets:scan` / `secrets:check` CLI |
| Internationalisation | Per-bundle JSON catalogs, `t()` helper, swig + nunjucks `t` filter, CLDR plurals, ICU MessageFormat opt-in via `t.icu()` |
| Exact money | `lib.money` / `gina.money` — ISO 4217 minor-unit integer arithmetic (BigInt-safe), strict wire-string parsing, same-currency guards; display via `Intl.NumberFormat` |
| Idempotency keys | Opt-in `Idempotency-Key` dedup at the router band (IETF draft): retried mutations replay the recorded first response — 409 while in flight, 422 on payload reuse, principal-scoped over the kv primitive |
| Message validation | `param.messageValidator` — a route-level seam running the raw request body through an application-supplied validator (XSD sidecar, JSON Schema, anything) before the action: boot-compiled factory, sync or async, fail-closed 400/422/503 refusals with `Retry-After` on checker outage |
| XML in and out | `application/xml`, `text/xml` and `application/*+xml` request bodies reach the action verbatim on `req.body`; `self.renderXML()` sends pre-serialised responses with the right content type and charset. The application brings its own XML library — the framework parses none and builds none |
| Observability | Built-in `/_gina/metrics` Prometheus endpoint (opt-in, IP-allowlisted) — process metrics + HTTP counter / duration histogram with cardinality-safe route labels; structured JSON logs with request ids (`GINA_LOG_FORMAT=json`) |
| Dev Inspector | Embedded dev SPA at `/_gina/inspector` — request data, live logs, SQL with index-coverage badges, flow timings, app events, AI token stream |
| OpenAPI & MCP | `bundle:openapi` emits OpenAPI 3.1 from `routing.json`; `bundle:mcp` emits an MCP tool manifest; built-in MCP runtime server (stdio + Streamable HTTP) |
| TypeScript & ESM | Typed public surface (shipped `.d.ts`), `bundle:types` generates entity types from DTOs, dual CJS / ESM exports |
| Hot reload | WatcherService evicts `require.cache` only on file change — zero per-request overhead in dev |
| K8s ready | `gina-container`, `gina-init`, SIGTERM drain, JSON stdout logging |
| Container tooling | `image:build` synthesizes an OCI image (buildah), `image:run` / `container:ps` / `container:stop` (podman) — local or over SSH |
| Dependency injection | Mockable connectors and config for unit testing |
| Runtime | Node.js 22–26, or **Bun** (`bun add -g gina`) — install + boot validated end-to-end by a CI Bun smoke, and the unit suite runs under `bun test` in CI behind an expected-failures gate |

## Quick start

```bash
npm install -g gina@latest --prefix=~/.npm-global   # or, on the Bun runtime: bun add -g gina
gina project:add @myproject --path=$(pwd)/myproject
gina bundle:add api @myproject
gina bundle:start api @myproject
open https://localhost:3100
```

> **npm 12+** blocks install scripts by default, and gina's post-install bootstraps `~/.gina` and the framework dependencies. Install with `npm install -g gina@latest --allow-scripts=gina`, or allow it once for all global installs with `npm config set allow-scripts=gina --location=user`. (Not needed on npm ≤ 11.)

## What's in 0.7.2

> **Restart your bundles *and* rebuild them.** The staged-upload, popin and asset-URL
> changes are browser-bundled, so `gina.min.js` changed and `gina bundle:restart`
> alone leaves the old client running: rebuild each consuming bundle, then restart
> it. If your build copies `gina.min.js` into your own static files, rebuild that
> copy before the restart.

> **Read before upgrading — some changes can change an answer.** In production, the
> asset URLs gina writes now carry a `?v=` content token, and the statics it serves
> answer `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` when the token matches.
> This is on by default: `assetVersioningEnabled: false` in `templates.json > _common`
> keeps the plain URLs, and a front server that serves your statics should send
> tokened requests to the bundle. A staged-upload transport failure now says the
> request "did not complete", the upload form of a staged input whose name has no
> brackets gets a new id (`gina-upload-<name>-<form id>`), and a route whose `param`
> already used a key named `lane` for its own data now declares a fast-lane route.
> The [migration notes](https://gina.io/docs/migration) list every behaviour change.

**The staged-uploads release.** The four reports of issue #83 lead it: the
staged-upload error slot rendered a server's error text as markup (an advisory), a
form posted a file input's `C:\fakepath\` placeholder, a submit could leave while
its upload was still running, and a request that failed in transit said it never
reached the server. Five more staged-upload and popin fixes found on the way, two
new features — versioned asset URLs that browsers keep for a year, and an opt-in
fast lane that answers a JSON route without building a controller — and fixes to
precompressed statics, HTTP/2 error metrics and the SQLite session store. Full
detail in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

- **Security — a staged upload's error message is shown as text (#B727).** The upload error slot used `innerHTML`, so a proxy's or WAF's HTML error page, or a server error that echoes request text such as a rejected filename, became live markup in the page.
- **Security — the `engine.io` floor rises to `^6.6.10` (#S12).** On an existing session, a transport-upgrade request could crash a bundle whose `settings.json` sets `ioServer.integrationMode` to `"attach"` (GHSA-2gc4-cqfq-p2gv); an install of this version can no longer resolve an affected release.
- **Added — versioned asset URLs (#P48).** In production the `<link>` and `<script>` tags gina writes from `templates.json`, their preload hints and the client routing table carry a content token, and the statics gina serves answer `immutable` for a year when the token names the file's current bytes, so a deploy that changes a file changes its URL. On by default.
- **Added — the fast lane (#P49).** A JSON route can name a function in the bundle's `lanes/` directory (`"param": { "lane": "users", "control": "list" }`) and skip the controller: a median 0.39 times the CPU of the controller route, about 150 µs less per request, in the measurement. Opt-in; this release refuses a lane route that declares a gate.
- **Fixed — staged uploads, issue #83 parts 1–3 (#B724, #B725, #B726).** A transport failure says the request did not complete (overridable as `gina.config.a11y.transportError`), a staged file input's placeholder value is no longer posted, and a submit made during an upload waits for it, then sends once with its metadata.
- **Fixed — staged uploads: choosing another file during an upload, an input without an error element, same-named inputs in two forms, and an input in a reopened popin (#B729, #B731, #B732, #B733).**
- **Fixed — `gina.popin.close(name)` tears down the popin's forms (#B756).** After a reopen they were left unbound.
- **Fixed — precompressed statics: a `.gz` copy goes out as `Content-Encoding: gzip`, and statics vary on `Accept-Encoding` (#B742, #B743).**
- **Fixed — on HTTP/2, an error answer is counted with its own status in the metrics, and no `headersSent` error follows a sent response (#B749, #B750).**
- **Fixed — the SQLite session store reads its path from `file` (#D47).** A path in `database`, as the docs showed, stopped the boot.
- **Fixed — a page whose query string ends in the routing table's path is answered by the page (#P48).**

## Governance

Gina is co-authored by **Martin Luther ETOUMAN NDAMBWE** ([Rhinostone](https://rhinostone.com)) and **Fabrice DELANEAU** ([fdelaneau.com](https://fdelaneau.com)). Final decisions on direction, API design, and releases rest with Martin Luther. Community contributions and RFCs are welcome and taken seriously. See [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md) for details.

## Supply-chain scanners

Gina is an MVC framework with a process-management CLI, so it uses Node's
`child_process` by design — to start and supervise application bundle processes
and the framework daemon, run local/SSH commands (`lib/shell`), launch the
inspector, and perform setup in the npm install scripts. Supply-chain scanners
therefore report a **Shell access** capability for `child_process`. This is
expected and intrinsic to a CLI framework, not a vulnerability: the install-time
commands are built only from local values (npm prefix, install path) and take no
network input.
